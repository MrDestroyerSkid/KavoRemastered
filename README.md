# KavoRemastered
A newer fan made version of KavoUI Library, design to make shit less buggier and extra themes ig ¯\_(ツ)_/¯. It also been improving script stability, patches and unable to load problem, it does do a update or patch when new roblox update release, you can use this as a fix and better version of Kavo and wait xHeptc to update, this also improve protection, specify execution, what type of executor you are using will use a different protection, it also had new new custom feature for UI so read CreateFunction if you want to use.

IM not a original creator of Kavo but if you want to use official kavo ui then you can go read this https://xheptcofficial.gitbook.io/kavo-library.

Is it recommend and require to use this fan made as your new library, if you using something Kavo UI on your script you only need to change library loadstring to loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MrDestroyerSkid/KavoRemastered/main/KavoUI.lua"))()
