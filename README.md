# KavoRemastered
A newer fan made version of KavoUI Library, design to make shit less buggier and extra themes ig ¯\_(ツ)_/¯. It also been improving script stability, patches and unable to load problem, it does do a update or patch when new roblox update release, you can use this as a fix and better version of Kavo and wait xHeptc to update, this also improve protection, specify execution, what type of executor you are using will use a different protection. IM not a original creator of Kavo but if you want to use official kavo ui then you can go read this https://xheptcofficial.gitbook.io/kavo-library.
