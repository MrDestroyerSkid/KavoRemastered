A newer fan made version of KavoUI Library. More better to use than original one for a while. Improving script stability, faster, better,more shitty themes, patches and fix few annoying thing, it does do a update or patch when new roblox update release, this also improve protection and new custom feature!!!!!

IM not a original creator of Kavo but if you want to use official kavo ui then you can go read this https://xheptcofficial.gitbook.io/kavo-library.

Is it recommend and require to use this fan made as your new library, if you using something Kavo UI on your script you only need to change library loadstring to ``loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MrDestroyerSkid/KavoRemastered/main/KavoUI.lua"))()``
